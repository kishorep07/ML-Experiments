##False Positives & Negatives
False: Wrong Prediction
Positive: Will Occur, Negative: Won't Occur

##Confusion Matrix
Top: Predicted(y^), Side: Actual(y)
(0,1): False Positive
(1,0): False Negative

Acc Rate = Correct / Total
Err Rate = Wrong / Total

##Accuracy Paradox
Sometimes abandoning a model (always 1) can actually inc Acc Rate. Thats why should not only use acc rate

##CAP (Cumulative Acc Profile) Curve [Not same as ROC]
One Line splits graph in half, which rep 0.5 prob (random)
Area b/w line and CAP curve shows how good model is (ap)
Cyrstal ball - best case scenario. (ar)
Curve under line, very bad model

##CAP Analysis:
AR = ar/ap
Simple Method - See the Y val for X=50%
	X < 60%			Rubbish
	60% < X < 70%	Poor
	70% < X < 80%	Good
	80% < X < 90%	Very Good
	90% < X < 100%	Too Good (careful for overfitting)
